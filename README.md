# This is your [AngularAttack](https://www.angularattack.com) 2016 Repo

This repo is the start of your AngularAttack 2016 entry. It contains the simple [Angular2 starter](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) files.

**DO NOT MAKE ANY CODE CHECKINS TO THIS REPOSITORY BEFORE THE COMPETITION OFFICIALLY BEGINS.**

**DOING SO COULD DISQUALIFY YOU.**

### Step 2) [optional] Deploy Your App

While you can't make any checkins before the comp, what you **can** do right now is deploy this sample app to [Surge](https://surge.sh) (our competition hosting provider).

Note: please do not remove the `CNAME` file, as that tells it where to deploy to.

If you receive an error message `"You do not have permission to publish to just-magic.2016.angularattack.io"`, it might mean another team member has already deployed your project to Surge. Ask them to run the next step to give you access.
